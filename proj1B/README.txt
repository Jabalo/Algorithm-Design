PROJ1B

1.Names:
	Hannah Choi (m2d0b)

2. It took us about 3 days (around 5 hours each day).

3. We went to some office hours, we also asked other students in the same class for advice. 

4.	index.cc = Main code and functions.
	index.h = Initializations and struct functions.
	Makefile = Makefile for compiling index.cc and index.h.
	README.txt = This file!

5. We forgot to hand in README.txt for PROJ1A...it took us around the same amoumt of time and got help from office hours and some students in the same class. Also our code for proj1B compiles and runs without any Segmentation Fault but produces the wrong result. We didn't have enough time to finish it but tried to fix our code as much as we can. Our best guess for what went wrong in our program is mainly in find(word) and insert(word). Our output txt file is missing some words, some duplicates, and the occurences of each word do not add up properly. We suspect this is because of pointers. We also did not code the program to print page numbers in the desired format (e.g. 1-5) due to the fact that the words did not update properly in our SkipList.
